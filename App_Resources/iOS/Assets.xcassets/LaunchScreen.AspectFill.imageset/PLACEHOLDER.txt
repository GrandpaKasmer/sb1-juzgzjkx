PLACEHOLDER FOR LAUNCH SCREEN BACKGROUND IMAGES

To generate real launch screen background images, you need to:
1. Install the canvas module on a system that supports native modules
2. Run the generate-ios-icons.js script
3. Copy the generated images to this directory

For App Store submission, you will need properly sized launch screen background images.
